    <h1>Developing Intution: Enjoying what you do as a beginner.</h1>
    <h2>Programming is hard</h2>
    <p>Making a career out of it is even harder. But, is this the equivalent
    of saying that being a lawyer is hard, or even running a small business?
    The point is, that this life is hard. For career switchers, becoming a
        software engineer might seem like a fast track to life in the easy
        lane. Good pay, and relatively high demand for the skill set makes
        software engineering a hot commodity. At record rates, people are
        coming into the profession and loving the allure of such a career.
        The question becomes, how long does this last.
    </p>
    <h2>So you have the job...</h2>
    <p>The thing is, once you get the job, things only get more difficult.
        Now there are benchmarks from which you derive a certain output.
        Those benchmarks might be resonable or they might be astronomically
        out of your league. It might be difficult to focus on what to learn
        because, as professionals of a sought after skill, we are constantly
        being exposed to the latest and greatest piece of technology. This is
        a choose your own adventure game. Finding some aspect of joy in it is
        important. In life we are constantly faced with having to make a
        choice and it's oftent he truth that, if we side with a feeling that
        resides in our body and heart, we would likely be prone to having the
        kind of career we want. Objects of the mind are just that and fickle.
        Ask yourself these questions, ask for support and guide your
        evolution in a way that's unique to your qualifications.
    </p>

    <h2>Iterate through your good ideas</h2>
    <p>Where most people loose sight of enjoyment is where they loose sight
    of themselves. Day after day, year after year, we are being validated by
        expanding on the vision of others. I'm proposig that less time be
        spent iterating through other's dreams and more time spendt in your
        world craftig, creating and communicating.
    </p>
