    <h1>Architecturing a new Angular Project</h1>
    <h2>Sometimes you build to learn...and that means to fail</h2>
    <p>I've stated earlier that personal projects are the gateway towards
        developing one's confidence in an endeavor. I'm working on a habit
        tracker, to keep track of my habits and eventually to provide me
        feedback on how I am doing and building towards my own goals.
    </p>
    <h2>Let your creativity wander</h2>
    <p>Sometimes in thinking through a software project, I get caught up in
        the details. Things like, how am I going to have the list refresh
        after adding a new product. Am I making the right initial decisions.
        I've found solace in breaking that thought pattern. Engaging with
        visual diagrams has been a helpful way to help me navigate the
        process. Being open to the process of design allows a lot more
        flexibility to what it is that you engineer.

        Below are some of my simple proof of concepts that cover what I
        wanted most out of my habit tracker. A list of high level habits that
        I want to accomplish and a view that shows me the days that I've
        accomplished those habits on a calendar.
    </p>

    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;
    justify-content:
    center">
        <div style="display: flex;
        flex-direction: column; align-items: center;" >
            <img style="width: 700px" src="images/img.png">
            <p>An image of the main screen where habits are entered for on a
            daily basis</p>
            <img style="width: 700px" src="images/calendar-details.png">
            <p>An image of a calendar which will display the completed /
                missed habits per day.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Just the beginning</h2>
    <p>There's a point in any new product where the excitment is overriden
        by the work. In fact, getting this prepared I was stuck on a
        specific issue around setting up my login page that took days to
        resolve. That's okay. It's important to develop a muscle of
        persistence in the face of the seemingly unimportant details. The
        truth of the matter is that, the details are super important. It's
        often easy to fantisize about an outcome that you want but what's in
    the space between is the work and you can work to avoid the work (think
        about it) or you can see the work as something that is to be gotten
        through. If you're not feeling that sense of cutting through
        something then it might be a time to take a look at how you would
        like to spend your energy. It might be software engineering but
        perhaps in a different novel way?</p>

    <p>Work, Reflect, Relax and Repeat.</p>
